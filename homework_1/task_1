% This code is a Variable Operations Code that will calculate the area of a
%    circle when given a radius, and also calculate the circumference with
%    the radius as well. 

% Radius of Circle 
radius = 5;

% Area of Circle
Area = (pi*radius^2);
    fprintf("Area: %f units squared \n", Area)

% Circumference of Circle 
Circumference = (2*pi*radius);
    fprintf("Circumference: %f units \n", Circumference)

% End of Variable Operations Code


% This code is a Temperature Converter, where user-entered Celsius readings
%   will be converted to Fahrenheit.  

% Prompt the user to enter a Celsius reading 
S = input('Enter your temperature');

% Conversion Equation for Celsius to Fahrenheit 
 F = (S * 9/5) + 32; 

% Display Conversion to User
   fprintf("The Temperature is %f Fahrenheit \n", F)

% Extreme Heat Warning (When over 100F) 
    if F > 100
    fprintf("It's a hot day! Stay Safe! \n")

    end 

% End of the Temperature Converter Code 


% This code is a Grocery Shopping Calculator, where users will input thier
%   groceries and get thier final total. 

% Grocery Prices: 

% Beef 
B = 15.50; 

% Dragonfruit
D = 2.50; 

% Potato
P = 5.00; 

% Lemon
L = 3.50; 

% Jalapeno 
J = 7.00; 

% Prompt user for how many of each item they would like to buy 
    num_B = input('How much Beef would you like to buy?'); 

    num_D = input('How much Dragonfruit would you like to buy?'); 

    num_P = input('How many Potato would you like to buy?');

    num_L = input('How many Lemons would you like to buy?'); 

    num_J = input('How many Jalapenos would you like to buy?'); 

% Calculuate the cost of all of the items in the user's shopping cart 

Cost = (num_B*B)+(num_D*D)+(num_P*P)+(num_L*L)+(num_J*J); 

% Calculate the discount (if it needs to be applied) 
    if Cost > 50 
       Discount_Cost = Cost*0.9;

% Display Discounted and Non-Discounted Price 
           fprintf("Normal Cost = $%f \n", Cost); 
           fprintf("Discounted Cost = $%f \n", Discount_Cost); 

    else 

% Display Normal Price 
        NonDiscounted_Cost = Cost; 
        fprintf("Normal Cost = $%f \n", Cost);

    end 

% End of the Grocery Shopping Calculator 

% This a code for a Number Guessing Game, where users will input a number,
%   and the code will give hints as to wether the correct number is higher
%   or lower than what they guessed. 

% Generate a random number between 1 and 100 
generated_number = randi(100); 

% Establish the guess counter
guess_count = 0; 

% Indicate whether the user guessed correct
correct_guess = false;

% Keep asking for guesses until the guess is correct
while ~correct_guess

    % Prompt the user to guess a number 
    user_guess = input('Please guess a number between 1 and 100:');
    
    % Add to the guess count for every guess made
    guess_count = guess_count + 1;
    
    % Give feedback when the guess is too low
    if user_guess > generated_number
        disp('Too high!');
        
    % Give feedback when the guess is too high    
    elseif user_guess < generated_number
        disp('Too low!');

    % Notify user they are correct, and state how many attempts it took
    else
        disp(['Correct! You guessed the number in ', num2str(guess_count), ' attempts']);
        correct_guess = true;
